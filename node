JS can be runned inside a browser
V8 engine developed by google compiles JavaScript into machine code
Node.js is a program written in C++
It wraps the V8 engine.
We can directly run JS on a computer or a server and not just a browser using node.

Adds extra functionalities to JS like
1. Read and write files on the computer
2. Connect to database
3. Act as a server for content

Acts as a server side language
Node lost the feature of DOM since it is runned outside the browser.
Due to node computers can now understand javascript and can compile it down to machine code

Role of Node.js
-> Run JS on backend or server side and handle requests coming in from a browser.
